Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time between bug fixing and formatting code to actually start the front-end, but if I had the time I would've probably used Laravel's default templating engine because of simplistic this application is or rather just used vanilla JS. The whole point of modern JS frameworks is component-oriented programming. There's no reusuable components for what we needed to use I don't think, and if I did use them it'd be an overuse situation where we could potentially be screwed if it were a real app. By which I mean the application would be a field of dependency landmines, and coming from a strong PHP background I fully realize what that means for an app when the framework/libraries/tools are no longer popular.
